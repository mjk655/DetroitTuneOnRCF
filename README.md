# The Detroit Tune

Working directory for the STAR PYTHIA 8 tune - The 'Detroit' Tune. A file with the specific Detroit tune settings to add to your customized .cmnd (or .cc) file is [here](detroit.cmnd)

A working example to run PYTHIA 8 and rivet on RCF is outlined in [this file](pythia_rivet_working_example.md). Note this PYTHIA example is setup to produce HepMC output. One can easiliy use PYTHIA 8 "out-of-the-box" in the same fashion, and/or also use the other main*.cc files provided by the PYTHIA authors to produce different output.
