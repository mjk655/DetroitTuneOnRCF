# STAR_PYTHIA8_Tune

Working directory for the STAR PYTHIA 8 tune - The 'Detroit' Tune. A working example to run pythia8 and rivet on RCF is outlined in [this file](pythia_rivet_working_example.md). Note this pythia example is setup to produce HepMC output. One can easiliy use PYTHIA 8.303 "out-of-the-box" in the same way, and/or also use the other main* files to produce different output. A file with the Detroit tune settings to add to your customized .cmnd file is [here](detroit.cmnd)
